1. run main_mG_sti  to obtain the noise_mG_sti_1000.mat which contains the fractional activations of species at t=24h for the single switch. Multicores are required. 
2. run main_mtG_sti to obtain the noise_mtG_sti_1000.mat which contains the fractional activations of species at t=24h for coupled switches. Multicores are required. 
3. finally, run main_plot_alignment to plot Figures 4A-B.


3. run main_mG_sti_link  to obtain the noise_mG_sti_link_1000.mat. Multicores are required. 
4. run main_mtG_sti_link to obtain the noise_mtG_sti_link_1000.mat. Multicores are required. 
5. run main_mG_sti_spec  to obtain the noise_mG_sti_spec_1000.mat. Multicores are required. 
6. run main_mtG_sti_spec to obtain the noise_mtG_sti_spec_1000.mat. Multicores are required. 
7. finally, run main_plot_dose_response to plot Figures 6B-C, and 6G
