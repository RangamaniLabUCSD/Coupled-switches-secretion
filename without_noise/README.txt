1. run main_endo_shControl.m first to obtain tg.fig and matlab.shC.mat (Y is time course data)
2. then run main_endo_shGIV to add tG* dynamics for shGIV cells in to tg.fig, matlab.GIV.mat containing time course data Y is also obtained. 
3. go to the folder "experimental_data_only" to plot experimental data and fit them with Hill functions
4. return back to this folder, and run main_arrow23.m to obtain dynamics in the absence of arrows 2 or 3.
