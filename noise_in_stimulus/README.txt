1.  run main_mG_sti to obtain the noise_mG_sti_1000.mat which contains the fractional activations of species at t=24h for the single switch. Multicore server is required. 
2. run main_mtG_sti to obtain the noise_mtG_sti_1000.mat which contains the fractional activations of species at t=24h for coupled switches. Multicore server is required. 
3. finally, run main_plot to plot figures.
